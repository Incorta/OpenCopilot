I would give you a json task description, containing initial result.

I want you to study the goal and purpose of the task, and study the initial result, to produce a final result.

In other words, if the purpose is to search for a single element, and the result looks to be an array, then choose one entry and replace the initial result with the final result

Remember, be concise, give me ONLY ONLY ONLY the json (And Validate the JSON format, to make sure that it's parsable. I.e. strings are double-quoted)

The command used to get the initial result:

{{ initialCommand }}

Here you're the task with initial task result:

{{ taskJson }}

Validate the JSON format, to make sure that it's parsable. I.e. strings and keys are always double-quoted

rewrite the tasks' json after replacing the initial result with the final result. 

Be concise and accurate. I.e., don't add a result of your own if the initial result doesn't contain what's needed.
