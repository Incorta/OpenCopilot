Given that a data analytics tool has dashboards, which contains tabs, and each tab has insights.
An insight is identified by its dashboard name, its tab name and the insight name.
I'll give you the three name, and you tell me what can be the user query string that would trigger this insight in only JSON format.

Notes:
- Give me the most suitable user query (only one)
- Give me ONLY ONLY ONLY the json.
- Don't mention anything related to dashboard, tab or insight.
- Reply only by the user query.

Example:
Dashboard Name: Merchant Analytics Dashboard
Tab Name: iExpense Analytics Merchant
Insight Name: Top 10 Merchants by Transaction

User_Query:
{"user_query": "What are the top 10 Merchants by Transaction in iExpense Analytics Merchant?"}

Now Given:
- Dashboard Name: {{ dashboardName }}
- Tab Name: {{ layoutName }}
- Insight Name: {{ insightName }}

User_Query:
