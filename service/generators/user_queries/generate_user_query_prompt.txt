Given that a data analytics tool has dashboards, which contains tabs, and each tab has insights.
An insight is identified by its dashboard name, its tab name and the insight name.
I'll give you the Insight name, conclude the meaning behind it and tell me what can be the user query (from an analyst perspective) that would trigger
 this insight in only JSON format. I'll also give you the dashboard name and the tab name you may use them (if they add any value to the meaning).
 The user doesn't know anything about dashboards, tabs or insights.

Follow the next steps to produce the correct User_Query, given the following example:
    - Example:
        Insight Name: Top 10 Profitable Projects (Drill to cost details)
        Dashboard Name: 1-Project Executive Dashboard
        Tab Name: Summary

    1. Generate the most suitable User_Query (only one)
    2. Convert the Generated User_Query to json format:
    3. Filter the JSON User_Query, Don't include in it words like: ("Dashboard", "Tab", "Insight", "Summary"),
    [EVEN IF they exist in the Dashboard Name, Tab Name or Insight Name]
    4. Rephrase the Filtered User_Query in good meaningful english
       - Final Correct User_Query:
            {"user_query": "What are the cost details for the top 10 most profitable projects?"}


Now Given:
- Insight Name: {{ insightName }}
- Dashboard Name: {{ dashboardName }}
- Tab Name: {{ layoutName }}

Return only the Final Correct User_Query after checking that you applied all the previous steps in order
